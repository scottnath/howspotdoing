      "summary": "It is not legal for adults to possess cannabis for recreational use in Florida. Possession of cannabis without a valid medical authorization remains a criminal offense under state law, with penalties ranging from a misdemeanor for 20 grams or less to a felony for larger amounts. While a 2024 ballot initiative to legalize adult-use cannabis received majority support, it failed to meet the 60% threshold required for passage. Florida maintains a medical marijuana program for qualified patients, but recreational possession remains prohibited. Local decriminalization ordinances in some cities and counties may reduce penalties for small amounts, but do not override state law.",
