All cultivation must occur indoors in a secure, locked area not visible to the public.",
      "gov_quote": "Coloradans can grow cannabis in their homes for personal use. Up to six plants are allowed per Colorado resident over age 21, with as many as three plants flowering at one time. Counties and municipalities can pass stricter laws. Denver limits a home grow to 12 plants, even if there are three or more adults over age 21 in the residence. The laws are different for medical cannabis consumers. Cannabis plants must be kept in an enclosed, locked area that can’t be viewed openly. This means the plants can’t be outside. At homes with residents under 21, any cannabis grow area must be enclosed and locked in a separate space that minors can’t access. At homes without residents under 21, extra precautions must be taken to make sure any visiting youth don’t have access to cannabis plants. Homegrown cannabis or cannabis products can’t be sold to anyone. Only licensed cannabis businesses can sell cannabis products.",
