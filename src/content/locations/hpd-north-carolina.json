      "summary": "It is not legal for adults to possess cannabis in North Carolina. State law classifies marijuana as a Schedule VI controlled substance, and possession of any amount is a criminal offense, with penalties ranging from a Class 3 misdemeanor for up to 0.5 ounces to a Class I felony for more than 1.5 ounces. There are no provisions legalizing or decriminalizing adult-use cannabis possession outside of limited exceptions for hemp-derived products and tribal lands of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.",
      "gov_quote": "\"Except as provided in subsections (h) and (i) of this section, any person who violates G.S. 90-95(a)(3) with respect to: ... (4) A controlled substance classified in Schedule VI shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor, but any sentence of imprisonment imposed must be suspended and the judge may not require at the time of sentencing that the defendant serve a period of imprisonment as a special condition of probation. If the quantity of the controlled substance exceeds one-half of an ounce (avoirdupois) of marijuana or one-twentieth of an ounce (avoirdupois) of the extracted resin of marijuana, commonly known as hashish, the violation shall be punishable as a Class 1 misdemeanor. If the quantity of the controlled substance exceeds one and one-half ounces (avoirdupois) of marijuana, or three-twentieths of an ounce (avoirdupois) of the extracted resin of marijuana, commonly known as hashish, or if the controlled substance consists of any quantity of synthetic tetrahydrocannabinols or tetrahydrocannabinols isolated from the resin of marijuana, the violation shall be punishable as a Class I felony.\"",
