# How's Pot Doing in Ohio?

<p class="howsit">Cannabis is 90% legal in Ohio</p>

# Cannabis Legality in Ohio: A Comprehensive Overview
## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?
In Ohio, medical marijuana has been legal since 2016, and registered patients are allowed to possess THC-containing cannabis products. Under the Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program, patients can possess a maximum of 8 ounces (226.8g) of Tier I medical marijuana or 5.3 ounces (150.3g) of Tier II medical marijuana (NORML, 2023). These possession limits are specific to medical marijuana patients and are distinct from the possession limits for adult-use cannabis.
## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?
Yes, it is legal for medical marijuana patients in Ohio to purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. The state has established a regulated system for the sale of medical cannabis products to registered patients. The Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 3796:6 outlines the licensing requirements and operations of dispensaries, ensuring that patients have access to medical cannabis through legal channels (Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program, n.d.).
## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?
As of the information available up to November 2023, medical marijuana patients in Ohio are not permitted to grow their own THC-containing cannabis. The state's medical cannabis program does not allow for the personal cultivation of cannabis by patients. However, with the recent changes in legislation, it is important to stay updated as regulations may evolve (Leafly, 2023).
## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?
With the passage of Ohio Issue 2, the Marijuana Legalization Initiative, on November 7, 2023, it is now legal for adults aged 21 and over to possess THC-containing cannabis products in Ohio. The law permits the possession of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana or 15 grams of marijuana extract for recreational use. These provisions are set to take effect on December 7, 2023 (NORML, 2023).
## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?
Adults in Ohio will be able to purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed retail locations. The Division of Cannabis Control is responsible for regulating and licensing marijuana operators and facilities. While the provisions related to possession and home cultivation for adults will take effect on December 7, 2023, retail licenses for the sale of recreational cannabis are expected to be issued by late 2024 (Forbes, 2023).
## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?
Yes, adults in Ohio will be allowed to grow THC-containing cannabis for personal use. The approved initiative permits adults to cultivate up to six marijuana plants individually, with a maximum of twelve plants per household in a private residence where at least two adults reside. This aspect of the law will also become effective on December 7, 2023 (NORML, 2023).
In conclusion, Ohio has made significant strides in cannabis legalization for both medical and recreational use. Medical marijuana patients have access to THC-containing products through licensed dispensaries, although they are not allowed to cultivate cannabis themselves. Recreational users will soon enjoy the rights to possess, purchase, and grow cannabis, with specific regulations and limitations. It is crucial for individuals to adhere to the legal possession limits and to follow the upcoming regulations for retail sales and home cultivation. As the state progresses towards implementing these new laws, stakeholders, including consumers, businesses, and law enforcement, must stay informed about the legal landscape of cannabis in Ohio.
