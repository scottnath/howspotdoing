# Cannabis Legality Report: Nebraska

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

As of the current date, November 17, 2023, it is illegal for medical marijuana patients to possess THC-containing cannabis products in Nebraska. Despite efforts to introduce legislation that would allow for medical marijuana, such as Legislative Bill 588 (LB 588), known as the Medicinal Cannabis Act, no law has been enacted to legalize medical marijuana in the state. LB 588 aimed to legalize medical marijuana for qualifying patients with consent from a licensed physician and would have allowed patients to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana and use marijuana-infused products with a maximum of 2,000 mg of THC. However, this bill has not been passed into law (Nebraska State Cannabis Laws, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

In Nebraska, medical marijuana patients do not have the legal right to purchase THC-containing cannabis products in stores or dispensaries. The state has not established a legal framework for the sale of medical marijuana, and as such, there are no state-licensed dispensaries or provisions for the sale of THC-containing cannabis products for medical use (Marijuana and the Law, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

The cultivation of THC-containing cannabis for medical purposes is not legal in Nebraska. There are no laws or regulations that allow medical marijuana patients to grow their own cannabis plants. Legislative efforts such as LB 588 did not include provisions for home cultivation by patients (High Times, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Possession of THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use remains illegal in Nebraska. The state has partially decriminalized marijuana, treating first-time possession of less than one ounce as an infraction with a $300 fine. However, possession of larger amounts can lead to more severe penalties, including jail time (CFAH, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Adults in Nebraska are not permitted to purchase THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use, as the state has not legalized recreational marijuana. Legislative Bill 634 (LB 634), also known as the Cannabis Control Act, sought to legalize recreational marijuana for adults aged 21 and over, including provisions for the commercial sale of adult-use marijuana, but this bill has not been enacted into law (Nebraska State Cannabis Laws, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

The cultivation of THC-containing cannabis for recreational purposes is illegal in Nebraska. While LB 634 proposed to allow adults to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use, this legislation has not been passed. Therefore, adults are currently not allowed to cultivate their own cannabis plants in the state (NORML, 2023).

In conclusion, as of November 17, 2023, both medical and recreational cannabis remain illegal in Nebraska. There have been legislative efforts to change this status, but none have successfully passed into law. The possession, purchase, and cultivation of THC-containing cannabis products are not permitted for either medical patients or adults. It is important for individuals to remain aware of the legal status of cannabis in their state and to follow the current laws and regulations. For the most accurate and up-to-date information on cannabis laws in Nebraska, individuals should consult official sources and legal authorities.
