# Cannabis Legality in New Jersey

## Is it legal for medical marijuana patients to possess THC-containing cannabis products?

In New Jersey, it is legal for medical marijuana patients to possess THC-containing cannabis products. The state has established a medical marijuana program under the Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act, which allows registered patients with qualifying conditions to obtain and use cannabis for medicinal purposes. The possession limits for medical marijuana patients are specified by law, with the maximum quantity allowed being 3 ounces in 30 days, unless the patient is terminal, in which case the quantity is unlimited (norml.org; newjerseystatecannabis.org). It is important to note that these possession limits have not seen any recent changes as of October 2022, and patients are expected to adhere to these regulations.

## Is it legal for medical marijuana patients to buy THC-containing cannabis products in a store?

Yes, medical marijuana patients in New Jersey are legally permitted to purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. The dispensaries are regulated by the state to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. Patients are required to present their medical marijuana identification card along with a valid government-issued ID to make purchases (nj.gov/cannabis).

## Is it legal for medical marijuana patients to grow THC-containing cannabis?

No, it is not legal for medical marijuana patients to grow THC-containing cannabis in New Jersey. The state's medical marijuana program does not allow for the personal cultivation of cannabis by patients. All medical cannabis must be obtained through state-licensed dispensaries, and the cultivation of cannabis is restricted to licensed cultivators and dispensaries authorized by the Cannabis Regulatory Commission (CRC) (onlinemedicalcard.com).

## Is it legal for adults to have THC-containing cannabis products?

Yes, adults aged 21 and older in New Jersey are legally allowed to possess THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use. The possession of cannabis for personal use was legalized through a ballot measure in November 2020. However, the regulatory framework for the legal sale and possession of recreational cannabis is still being developed, and sales are expected to begin in 2022 (njleg.state.nj.us).

## Is it legal for adults to buy THC-containing cannabis products in a store?

As of the current date, November 17, 2023, adults aged 21 and older can purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries in New Jersey. The state has established a regulated market for the sale of recreational cannabis, and licensed dispensaries are authorized to sell cannabis products to adults. The CRC regulates the sale and distribution of recreational cannabis to ensure compliance with state laws and regulations (nj.gov/cannabis).

## Is it legal for adults to grow THC-containing cannabis?

No, adults in New Jersey are not currently allowed to grow their own THC-containing cannabis plants for recreational use. The cultivation of cannabis is limited to licensed cultivators and dispensaries authorized by the CRC. Legislation is being considered to potentially allow for home cultivation in the future, but as of now, personal cultivation is not permitted (njleg.state.nj.us).

In conclusion, New Jersey has established legal frameworks for both medical and recreational cannabis use. Medical marijuana patients have the right to possess and purchase THC-containing products from licensed dispensaries, but they cannot grow their own cannabis. Recreational use is also legal for adults, with the ability to purchase from dispensaries, but again, without the right to personal cultivation. It is crucial for individuals to follow the state's guidelines and regulations regarding cannabis possession, purchase, and use. For the most current and accurate information, official sources such as the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission should be consulted.
