# How's Pot Doing in Georgia?

<p class="howsit">Cannabis is 20% legal in Georgia</p>

# Cannabis Legality in Georgia: A Comprehensive Overview

The legal landscape of cannabis in the state of Georgia is complex and has undergone significant changes in recent years. This report aims to provide a detailed analysis of the current legal status of cannabis for both medical marijuana patients and adults, addressing possession, purchase, and cultivation.

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

In Georgia, medical marijuana patients are legally permitted to possess THC-containing cannabis products, albeit with certain restrictions. The state has legalized the use of low-THC cannabis oil for medical purposes under the Haleigh's Hope Act. Qualifying patients with specific medical conditions are allowed to possess up to 20 ounces of low-THC oil, which can contain no more than 5% THC (Rabb Wilkerson Law, 2023; Wikipedia, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Yes, medical marijuana patients in Georgia can legally purchase low-THC cannabis oil from licensed dispensaries. The Georgia Access to Medical Cannabis Commission (GMCC) has awarded licenses to companies that can operate dispensaries across the state. Patients must be registered and obtain a Low-THC Oil Registry Card to purchase these products (WUGA, 2023; Wikipedia, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

No, the cultivation of THC-containing cannabis by medical marijuana patients is not permitted in Georgia. The state's medical marijuana program only allows for the possession and purchase of low-THC cannabis oil and does not extend to the personal cultivation of cannabis plants for any purpose (Wikipedia, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Recreational use of THC-containing cannabis products is illegal in Georgia. Possession of marijuana for non-medical purposes is still prohibited under state law. However, possession of up to one ounce of marijuana has been decriminalized in several cities, such as Atlanta, where it may result in fines rather than criminal charges. Possession of more than one ounce is considered a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in jail and a $5,000 fine (The Cannabis Watcher, 2023; Stemless, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

The sale of THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use is not legal in Georgia. The state has not established a legal framework for the sale of recreational cannabis. Only medical marijuana patients with a valid registry card can legally purchase low-THC oil from licensed dispensaries (Wikipedia, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Adults in Georgia are not allowed to grow THC-containing cannabis for personal or recreational use. The state's laws strictly prohibit the cultivation of cannabis outside of the regulated medical marijuana program. This restriction applies to all adults, regardless of whether the intended use is medical or recreational (Wikipedia, 2023).

## Conclusion

As of November 17, 2023, Georgia maintains a legal medical marijuana program that allows for the possession and purchase of low-THC cannabis oil by registered patients. However, the cultivation of cannabis by patients and the possession, purchase, and cultivation of cannabis for recreational use by adults remain illegal. While there has been progress in the medical cannabis sector, with the expansion of licenses and dispensaries, recreational cannabis has not seen legalization in the state. It is important for individuals to adhere to the current legal framework and to consult with legal professionals or official sources for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding cannabis laws in Georgia.
