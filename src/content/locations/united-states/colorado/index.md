# How's Pot Doing in Colorado?

<p class="howsit">Cannabis is 100% legal in Colorado</p>

# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

In Colorado, the possession of THC-containing cannabis products for medical marijuana patients is legal. This legality stems from Amendment 20, passed in 2000, which legalized medical marijuana for individuals with qualifying medical conditions. Patients and their primary caregivers are provided affirmative protection under this amendment, which also outlines the procedures for obtaining a medical marijuana card. The possession limits and restrictions on use are specified within the amendment and have remained in place as of 2023 (Colorado Cannabis Laws, n.d.).

# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Medical marijuana patients in Colorado have the legal right to purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. The state has operational licensed dispensaries that cater to the needs of patients with a valid medical marijuana card. The recent bill SB23-081 has increased the limit on the amount of medical marijuana concentrate that a patient can purchase in a single day from 8 grams to 40 grams, although the total amount a patient can purchase in a 30-day period is still limited to the equivalent of 8 grams per day. There are exceptions for nonedible, nonpsychoactive medical marijuana products (Colorado General Assembly, n.d.).

# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Medical marijuana patients in Colorado are permitted to grow their own cannabis plants. The law allows patients 18 and over to cultivate up to six plants per household, with a maximum of three plants in the flowering stage at any given time. This cultivation must occur in an enclosed, locked area that is not visible to the public, and the plants cannot be grown outside. The maximum number of plants allowed per household is 12 (CFAH, n.d.; NORML, n.d.).

# Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Yes, adults aged 21 and older in Colorado can legally possess THC-containing cannabis products. The legal possession limit for recreational cannabis is up to one ounce, while medical patients are allowed up to two ounces. This is in line with the state's recreational marijuana laws, which have been in effect since the passage of Amendment 64 in 2012 (Colorado Cannabis Tours, n.d.).

# Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Adults aged 21 and older are legally allowed to purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries in Colorado. The state has a regulated system for cannabis sales, and all transactions must go through authorized channels. House Bill 1317, effective as of November 2023, has imposed restrictions on the amount of retail and medical marijuana concentrates that can be purchased, with individuals over 21 limited to eight grams per business day (303 Magazine, n.d.).

# Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Adults in Colorado are allowed to grow marijuana in their homes for personal use, with the law permitting up to six plants, and no more than three flowering at a time. However, local jurisdictions may have stricter laws. For example, Denver limits home grows to 12 plants. It is important to note that it is illegal to sell homegrown marijuana or marijuana products, as only licensed businesses can engage in sales (Cannabis Colorado Gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, as of November 2023, both medical marijuana patients and adults aged 21 and over in Colorado have the legal right to possess, purchase, and grow THC-containing cannabis within the limits established by state law. Medical marijuana patients have specific allowances for possession and cultivation, and recent legislative changes have adjusted the amounts that can be purchased. For recreational users, the state has set clear guidelines for possession and cultivation, with local jurisdictions having the authority to impose additional restrictions. It is always advisable for individuals to consult official sources or legal professionals for the most up-to-date information on cannabis laws in Colorado.
