# How's Pot Doing in Pennsylvania?

<p class="howsit">Cannabis is 20% legal in Pennsylvania</p>

# Cannabis Legality Report: Pennsylvania

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

In Pennsylvania, medical marijuana has been legal since the state's Medical Marijuana Act was signed into law on April 17, 2016. As of 2023, patients who are registered under the state's medical marijuana program are legally permitted to possess THC-containing cannabis products. These products include cannabis-infused pills, oils, topical ointments, tinctures, liquids, and herbal cannabis for vaporization. Patients are allowed to possess up to a 90-day supply of these forms of medical marijuana. It is important to note that smoking cannabis remains prohibited under Pennsylvania law, and patients must adhere to the forms of consumption that are allowed (NORML, 2023; Pennsylvania State Cannabis, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Registered medical marijuana patients in Pennsylvania have the legal right to purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries across the state. The state has licensed up to 25 growers and processors, as well as 50 dispensaries that can operate three locations each, ensuring that patients have access to their medication. The law does not specify the exact quantity of marijuana that can be purchased at one time; however, registered pharmacists at these dispensaries are responsible for recommending the type and quantity of marijuana products that align with the patient's needs. Patients must follow these recommendations to avoid potential criminal penalties (NORML, 2023; Pennsylvania State Cannabis, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

As of 2023, home cultivation of medical marijuana by patients is not permitted in Pennsylvania. The cultivation of cannabis is restricted to licensed growers and processors who are responsible for supplying the medical marijuana market. There have been discussions and proposals to allow medical marijuana patients to grow their own cannabis, but these have not been successful so far. The state maintains strict control over the cultivation process to ensure compliance with regulations and to maintain the integrity of the medical marijuana program (NORML, 2023; Pennsylvania State Cannabis, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Recreational marijuana remains illegal in Pennsylvania as of 2023. Adults without a valid medical marijuana card are not legally allowed to possess THC-containing cannabis products. Possession of marijuana for recreational use is a criminal offense, with penalties varying based on the amount of marijuana involved. Possession of 30 grams or less can result in a maximum of 30 days in jail or a $500 fine. However, certain cities within the state have decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana, treating it as a civil violation rather than a criminal charge (Pennsylvania State Cannabis, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Since recreational marijuana is not legal in Pennsylvania, adults cannot legally purchase THC-containing cannabis products in a store for recreational purposes. All purchases of cannabis must be made through licensed medical marijuana dispensaries and are only available to registered patients with a valid medical card. The state does not have a system in place for the legal sale of recreational cannabis to adults (Pennsylvania State Cannabis, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Adults in Pennsylvania are not allowed to cultivate THC-containing cannabis for recreational purposes. The state has not legalized the home cultivation of cannabis for either medical or recreational use, except for a provision in Senate Bill 846 that would allow medical marijuana patients to grow up to five cannabis plants for personal therapeutic use. However, this bill has not been passed into law as of the current date, and therefore, the cultivation of cannabis by adults for any purpose remains illegal (Forbes, 2023).

## Future Considerations

There is ongoing legislative activity in Pennsylvania regarding the potential legalization of adult-use cannabis. Senate Bill 846, a bipartisan measure, has been introduced to legalize recreational marijuana for adults aged 21 and older. If passed, this bill would allow for the purchase and possession of up to 30 grams of cannabis and would legalize commercial cannabis production and sales, subject to taxation. Despite the introduction of this bill and the support from a majority of registered voters, there is not yet enough bipartisan support to ensure its passage. The future of cannabis legalization in Pennsylvania remains uncertain, with further hearings and discussions expected (Inquirer, 2023; PennLive, 2023).

In conclusion, as of November 18, 2023, medical marijuana is legal in Pennsylvania for registered patients, but recreational marijuana is not. The state has a structured medical marijuana program with licensed dispensaries, but home cultivation is not allowed. The potential for future legalization of recreational marijuana exists, but it is contingent on the passage of pending legislation.
