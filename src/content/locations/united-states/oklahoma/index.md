# How's Pot Doing in Oklahoma?

<p class="howsit">Cannabis is 30% legal in Oklahoma</p>

# Cannabis Legality in Oklahoma

The state of Oklahoma has a dynamic legal landscape concerning cannabis, with distinct regulations for medical marijuana patients and non-patients. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the current cannabis laws in Oklahoma as of November 18, 2023, addressing the legality of possession, purchase, and cultivation of THC-containing cannabis products for both medical patients and adults.

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Yes, it is legal for medical marijuana patients to possess THC-containing cannabis products in Oklahoma. Patients with a state-issued medical marijuana license are allowed to possess up to three ounces of marijuana on their person, up to eight ounces at their residence, one ounce of marijuana concentrates, and 72 ounces of edible marijuana products (PotGuide, 2023). These possession limits are among the most generous in the United States, reflecting Oklahoma's relatively permissive stance on medical cannabis.

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Yes, medical marijuana patients in Oklahoma can legally purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. The state has a well-established network of dispensaries that cater to the needs of medical marijuana patients. Patients and designated caregivers can purchase up to three ounces of flower, one ounce of concentrate, and 72 ounces of edibles from these dispensaries (Leafly, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Yes, medical marijuana patients in Oklahoma are permitted to grow cannabis for personal use. They are allowed to cultivate up to six mature plants and six seedlings within their primary residence, provided they have a valid medical marijuana patient license (Leafly, 2023). This provision enables patients to have a continuous supply of cannabis for their medical needs and is a significant aspect of Oklahoma's medical marijuana program.

## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

As of November 18, 2023, recreational use of THC-containing cannabis products is not legal in Oklahoma. However, State Question 820 (SQ 820), which was approved by voters on March 7, 2023, legalized the adult use of marijuana. Adults aged 21 and older are allowed to possess up to one ounce of cannabis flower, up to 8 grams of cannabis concentrates, and up to 8 grams of cannabis concentrates contained within an infused product (Leafly, 2023). It is important to note that while possession is legal, the opening of recreational weed stores is expected to occur in 2024, indicating a transition period for the establishment of a regulated adult-use market.

## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Currently, the purchase of THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use is not legal in Oklahoma. The infrastructure for the sale of recreational cannabis is under development following the passage of SQ 820. The Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority is tasked with posting the rules and regulations for a legal adult-use system no later than June 6, 2023, with retail sales licenses to be issued initially only to operators of state-licensed medical marijuana dispensaries that have been in business for at least one year as of February 8, 2023 (Leafly, 2023). Therefore, the legal purchase of cannabis for recreational use in stores is anticipated to begin in 2024.

## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Following the approval of SQ 820, it is legal for adults in Oklahoma to grow THC-containing cannabis. Each adult is permitted to grow up to six seedlings and six mature plants in or around a private residence (Leafly, 2023). This provision aligns with the state's approach to personal cultivation for medical marijuana patients, extending the right to grow cannabis to all adults aged 21 and over.

# Conclusion

In summary, as of November 18, 2023, Oklahoma has legalized the possession, purchase, and cultivation of THC-containing cannabis products for medical marijuana patients and has taken steps to legalize these activities for all adults. While the state is in a transition period for establishing a regulated adult-use market, the existing medical marijuana program continues to provide access to cannabis for qualifying patients. It is crucial for individuals in Oklahoma to stay informed about the evolving cannabis laws and to comply with the current regulations until the full implementation of the adult-use market.
