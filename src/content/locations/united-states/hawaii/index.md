# How's Pot Doing in Hawaii?

<p class="howsit">Cannabis is 30% legal in Hawaii</p>

# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

In Hawaii, medical marijuana patients are legally permitted to possess THC-containing cannabis products. Patients with qualifying conditions are allowed to purchase and possess marijuana from state-licensed dispensaries using a valid medical marijuana card, known as the Hawaii 329 Card (Hawaii State Cannabis Organization, n.d.). The Hawaii Department of Health's Medical Cannabis Registry Program enables patients and caregivers to legally acquire, possess, cultivate, use, distribute, and transport cannabis for medical use, with certain restrictions in place (Hawaii Department of Health, n.d.-a).

# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Yes, it is legal for medical marijuana patients to buy THC-containing cannabis products in a store. Patients with a Hawaii 329 Card can purchase cannabis from state-licensed dispensaries. The dispensaries are regulated and patients are required to present their medical marijuana card to make a purchase (Hawaii State Cannabis Organization, n.d.).

# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Home cultivation of cannabis for medical use is legal in Hawaii. A qualifying patient or their primary caregiver can grow up to ten cannabis plants, whether immature or mature, and possess up to four ounces of usable cannabis at any given time (Hawaii Department of Health, n.d.-b). This provision allows patients and caregivers to cultivate their own cannabis, ensuring access to their medicine.

# Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

As of the information available up to June 2023, recreational marijuana remains illegal in Hawaii. Possession of 3 grams or less of cannabis has been decriminalized, resulting in a fine of $130, but possession of larger amounts for non-medical use is not permitted (CFAH, 2023). However, there is a bill, SB 669, that has been approved by the Hawaii Senate to legalize recreational marijuana for adults aged 21 and older, which includes provisions for possession, but as of November 17, 2023, it has not been enacted into law (Forbes, 2023).

# Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Currently, there is no legal framework for the sale of recreational cannabis products in stores in Hawaii. The sale of THC-containing cannabis products is limited to medical marijuana patients at state-licensed dispensaries. The bill SB 669, if passed, would establish a Hawaii Cannabis Authority to regulate recreational marijuana cultivation, processing, and sales, but as of the current date, this has not been implemented (Forbes, 2023).

# Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

As of the information available up to June 2023, growing marijuana for recreational purposes is illegal in Hawaii. The bill SB 669 would permit the home cultivation of up to six cannabis plants, with a maximum of three mature, flowering plants for recreational use, but this bill has not yet become law (Forbes, 2023). Therefore, as of November 17, 2023, adults cannot legally grow THC-containing cannabis for recreational purposes in Hawaii.

In conclusion, while medical marijuana is legal in Hawaii, recreational marijuana is not yet legal. Medical marijuana patients have the right to possess, purchase, and grow cannabis for their personal medical use. However, recreational use, purchase, and cultivation of cannabis remain illegal, pending the enactment of new legislation. The legislative landscape is evolving, and there are active efforts to legalize recreational cannabis, which could change the current legal status. It is important for individuals to stay informed about the latest developments in cannabis legislation in Hawaii.
