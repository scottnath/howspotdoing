# Cannabis Legality in Kansas: Detailed Report

## Is It Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

As of the current date, November 17, 2023, the possession of THC-containing cannabis products for medical marijuana patients is not legal in the state of Kansas. Despite ongoing legislative efforts and discussions, medical marijuana remains illegal. Senate Bills 135 and 171, which proposed the legalization of medical marijuana, have been introduced but have not been enacted into law (Kansas State Cannabis, 2023; Marijuana Moment, 2023). Therefore, no legal framework exists that allows medical marijuana patients to legally possess THC-containing cannabis products in Kansas.

## Is It Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

In Kansas, there are no licensed dispensaries or legal avenues for medical marijuana patients to purchase THC-containing cannabis products in a store. The proposed Senate Bill 135 would have allowed patients to buy and possess up to a 30-day supply of cannabis from licensed dispensaries, but since the bill has not been passed, such transactions remain illegal (Marijuana Moment, 2023). Consequently, the purchase of THC-containing cannabis products by medical marijuana patients in a store is not permitted under current Kansas law.

## Is It Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

The cultivation of THC-containing cannabis by medical marijuana patients is illegal in Kansas. The state has not passed any legislation that would allow for the home cultivation of cannabis for medical purposes. All forms of cannabis cultivation are prohibited, and there are no exceptions for medical marijuana patients (Kansas State Cannabis, 2023). As such, patients are not legally allowed to grow their own THC-containing cannabis plants.

## Is It Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

For adults in Kansas, the possession of THC-containing cannabis products is illegal for both medical and recreational use. Possession of even small amounts of cannabis can lead to misdemeanor charges, with more severe penalties for larger quantities and repeated offenses (Criminal Defense Lawyer, 2023). The state has not enacted any laws that would permit the possession of THC-containing cannabis products by adults.

## Is It Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

The state has not established a legal market for the sale of recreational cannabis, and all marijuana-related transactions remain criminalized (Kansas State Cannabis, 2023). There are no licensed dispensaries or other legal retail outlets for the purchase of cannabis products by adults.

## Is It Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

The cultivation of THC-containing cannabis is illegal in Kansas for both medical and recreational purposes. The state has not passed any legislation that would allow adults to legally grow cannabis plants. Penalties for the cultivation of cannabis can range from level 4 to level 1 drug felonies, depending on the number of plants and other factors (Criminal Defense Lawyer, 2023). Therefore, adults are not permitted to grow their own THC-containing cannabis under current Kansas law.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, as of November 17, 2023, Kansas maintains strict prohibitions on the possession, purchase, and cultivation of THC-containing cannabis products for both medical patients and adults. Despite some legislative efforts and public support for medical marijuana legalization, no bills have been successfully passed to change the current legal status. Kansas residents, including medical marijuana patients, are subject to criminal penalties for any activities involving THC-containing cannabis. It is important for individuals to remain aware of the legal landscape and any future changes that may arise from ongoing legislative efforts.
