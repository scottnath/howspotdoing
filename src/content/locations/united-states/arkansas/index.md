# How's Pot Doing in Arkansas?

<p class="howsit">Cannabis is 20% legal in Arkansas</p>

# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

In Arkansas, the possession of THC-containing cannabis products is legal for medical marijuana patients who have been qualified and have obtained a medical marijuana card. The Arkansas Medical Marijuana Amendment, which was passed in 2016, allows these patients to legally possess up to 2.5 ounces of medical marijuana every 14 days from licensed dispensaries (arcannabisclinic.com, 2023). This possession limit has been consistent over the years and remains the same as of 2023 (arcannabisclinic.com, 2023).

# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Yes, it is legal for medical marijuana patients to purchase THC-containing cannabis products in a store, provided that the store is a state-licensed dispensary. The Arkansas Medical Marijuana Amendment permits the sale of medical cannabis to patients with a doctor's approval, and as of 2023, there are licensed dispensaries operating in the state where patients can make these purchases (arcannabisclinic.com, 2023; uaex.uada.edu, 2023).

# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

No, it is not legal for medical marijuana patients to grow THC-containing cannabis in Arkansas. The state laws do not permit home cultivation of medical marijuana, and all medical cannabis must be obtained from licensed dispensaries (cfah.org, 2023). This regulation is strictly enforced, and there are no indications that the law will change in the near future to allow home cultivation for medical purposes.

# Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Recreational possession of THC-containing cannabis products is illegal in Arkansas. Adults who are not medical marijuana patients are not allowed to possess cannabis, and doing so can result in legal repercussions, including fines and potential jail time (arcannabisclinic.com, 2023; cfah.org, 2023). As of November 2023, there has been no change in the law to allow recreational possession of cannabis.

# Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

As of November 2023, the purchase of THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use is not legal in Arkansas. The state has not legalized the sale of adult-use cannabis in stores, and only medical marijuana is permitted for purchase by qualified patients at licensed dispensaries (arkansascannabis.org, 2023).

# Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

The cultivation of THC-containing cannabis for recreational use is illegal in Arkansas. Adults are not permitted to grow cannabis for personal use, and there are penalties in place for those who violate this law (arcannabisclinic.com, 2023). The state regulates the cultivation of medical marijuana through the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission, but this is limited to licensed cultivation facilities and does not extend to personal cultivation for either medical or recreational purposes (arcannabisclinic.com, 2023).

In conclusion, as of November 2023, Arkansas maintains a medical marijuana program that allows qualified patients to possess and purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. However, the state does not permit the recreational use of cannabis, including possession, purchase, or cultivation. The legal landscape for cannabis in Arkansas is subject to change, and there have been movements towards legalization, but as of the current date, recreational cannabis remains illegal.
