<p class="howsit">Cannabis is 100% legal in Montana</p>

# Cannabis Legality in Montana

The legal landscape for cannabis in Montana has undergone significant changes in recent years, with both medical and recreational cannabis now legal under state law. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current legal status of cannabis possession, purchase, and cultivation in Montana as of November 17, 2023.

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Yes, it is legal for medical marijuana patients in Montana to possess THC-containing cannabis products. Medical cannabis was legalized in Montana in 2004 through a ballot initiative (Wikipedia, n.d.). Patients who are registered with the Montana Medical Marijuana Program are allowed to possess up to one ounce of usable medical cannabis (Potguide, n.d.). This includes a variety of products such as flower, concentrates, and edibles, as long as they comply with the state's regulations.

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Medical marijuana patients in Montana have the legal right to purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. These dispensaries are regulated by the state and provide a range of cannabis products to registered patients. Patients are allowed to purchase up to one ounce of cannabis per visit, with a limit of five ounces per month (CFah, n.d.). This ensures that patients have access to their medicine while also preventing excessive accumulation or potential diversion.

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Montana law permits medical marijuana patients to cultivate their own cannabis plants. Registered cardholders are allowed to grow up to four mature plants and four seedlings per household (MT Revenue, n.d.). This provision enables patients who may not have easy access to dispensaries or who prefer to produce their own medicine to do so within the confines of the law.

## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

For adults aged 21 and over in Montana, it is legal to possess THC-containing cannabis products. The law, which came into effect on January 1, 2021, allows adults to possess up to one ounce of marijuana (Wikipedia, n.d.). This includes all forms of cannabis, such as flower, concentrates, and edibles, provided that the total amount does not exceed the legal limit.

## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Adult-use, or recreational, cannabis sales began on January 1, 2022, in Montana. Adults aged 21 and older are permitted to purchase cannabis from state-licensed dispensaries in counties that voted in favor of Initiative I-190 (MT Revenue, n.d.). The possession limit for recreational users is the same as for medical patients, up to one ounce of marijuana flower or its equivalent in other forms.

## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

As of July 1, 2023, adults in Montana are allowed to cultivate their own THC-containing cannabis plants for personal use. The cultivation limits are up to two mature marijuana plants and two seedlings per individual, with a maximum of four mature plants and four seedlings per household (Wikipedia, n.d.). This change in law provides adults with the opportunity to grow cannabis for personal use, aligning with the rights already granted to medical marijuana patients.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, both medical and recreational cannabis are legal in Montana. Medical marijuana patients have the right to possess, purchase, and cultivate cannabis, while adults can possess, purchase, and grow cannabis for personal use. It is important to note that while state law permits these activities, cannabis remains illegal under federal law, and it is prohibited to consume or possess cannabis on federal lands and waters. Additionally, operating a motor vehicle under the influence of cannabis is illegal. The legal framework in Montana is designed to ensure that both patients and adults have access to cannabis while maintaining regulations to prevent misuse and diversion.
