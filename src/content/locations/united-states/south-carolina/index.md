## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

As of the current date, November 18, 2023, it is not legal for medical marijuana patients to possess THC-containing cannabis products in South Carolina. The state has not established a medical marijuana program, and therefore, no legal framework exists for patients to obtain or possess marijuana for medical purposes. Possession of any amount of marijuana, including for medical use, is subject to criminal penalties, including jail time and fines (cfah.org; snelllaw.com).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

In South Carolina, there are no state-licensed dispensaries, and the sale of THC-containing cannabis products for medical purposes is not legal. Medical marijuana patients do not have the legal right to purchase marijuana from any retail outlets within the state (ilovegrowingmarijuana.com; cannigma.com).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

The cultivation of THC-containing cannabis for medical purposes is illegal in South Carolina. Registered patients and caregivers are not permitted to grow marijuana, even if it is for medical use. The state law does not provide any allowances for the home cultivation of cannabis by medical marijuana patients (ilovegrowingmarijuana.com; cannigma.com).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Possession of THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use is illegal in South Carolina. The state treats cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance, and possession of even small amounts is considered a misdemeanor offense, with potential jail time and fines for those convicted (snelllaw.com; moabusaftlaw.com).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Adults in South Carolina cannot legally purchase THC-containing cannabis products in a store. The sale of marijuana for recreational use remains illegal, and there are no provisions within state law that allow for the operation of retail outlets selling cannabis for adult use (ilovegrowingmarijuana.com; cannigma.com).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

The cultivation of THC-containing cannabis for recreational purposes is not legal in South Carolina. Adults are not allowed to grow marijuana plants, and doing so can result in felony charges, especially if the amount grown is over one ounce, which is presumed to be for distribution (moabusaftlaw.com; ilovegrowingmarijuana.com).

## Future Prospects and Legislative Efforts

Despite the current prohibitive status of cannabis in South Carolina, there have been legislative efforts to change the state's stance on medical marijuana. State Senator Tom Davis re-filed a bill known as the S.C. Compassionate Care Act, which aims to legalize medical marijuana for patients with qualifying conditions. However, as of the latest information available, this bill has stalled and is not expected to proceed to a vote until at least 2024 (benzinga.com; moabusaftlaw.com).

Additionally, a joint resolution, S. 212, has been introduced, proposing a statewide advisory referendum to be held in conjunction with the 2024 General Election. This referendum would gauge public support for the legalization of marijuana for both medicinal and recreational purposes. However, until such measures are passed and enacted, the current laws remain in effect (scstatehouse.gov).

In conclusion, as of November 18, 2023, the possession, purchase, and cultivation of THC-containing cannabis products are illegal in South Carolina for both medical patients and adults. There are no legal protections or provisions for the use of medical or recreational cannabis. Individuals found in violation of these laws may face severe penalties. While there is legislative interest in reforming cannabis laws in the state, no changes have been officially made, and the future of cannabis legalization in South Carolina remains uncertain.
