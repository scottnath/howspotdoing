# How's Pot Doing in Arizona?

<p class="howsit">Cannabis is 100% legal in Arizona</p>

\# Cannabis Legality in Arizona

\## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Yes, it is legal for medical marijuana patients in Arizona to possess THC-containing cannabis products. The Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (AMMA), passed in 2010, allows patients and their caregivers to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana every two weeks (Arizona State Cannabis, n.d.). The Arizona Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that hash and cannabis extracts are also legal under the AMMA (CFAH, n.d.).

\## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Medical marijuana patients in Arizona can legally purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. The Arizona Department of Health Services regulates the possession of medical marijuana, and patients can possess up to an ounce of marijuana or five grams of marijuana concentrate for personal use (ARCannabisClinic, n.d.). The state maintains a directory of approved marijuana establishments where such transactions can occur (Arizona State Cannabis, n.d.).

\## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Medical marijuana patients in Arizona are permitted to cultivate cannabis. Patients are allowed to grow up to 12 plants for personal use, provided they live more than 25 miles from the nearest dispensary and have received approval from the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) (AskGrowers, n.d.; Marijuana and the Law, n.d.).

\## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Following the passage of Proposition 207 in November 2020, it is legal for adults aged 21 or older to possess THC-containing cannabis products in Arizona. Adults can possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana, with a maximum of 5 grams of marijuana concentrate (CHMLaw, n.d.; The Cannabis Watcher, n.d.).

\## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Adults aged 21 and over can legally purchase marijuana from over 100 dispensaries throughout Arizona. The commercial sale of marijuana for adults is permitted under the provisions of Proposition 207 (The Cannabis Watcher, n.d.).

\## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Adults in Arizona are allowed to cultivate up to six plants for non-commercial purposes in a private residence. Households with more than one adult can grow up to 12 plants. The cultivation must take place within an enclosed area on the grounds of the residence equipped with a lock or other security device that prevents access by minors (AZCentral, n.d.; Marijuana and the Law, n.d.).

\# Analysis and Discussion

The legal landscape for cannabis in Arizona has evolved significantly since the passage of the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act in 2010 and the subsequent approval of Proposition 207 in 2020. The state has established a framework that allows both medical patients and adults to possess, purchase, and cultivate cannabis within certain limits.

For medical marijuana patients, the AMMA provides a system through which they can obtain cannabis for therapeutic purposes. The inclusion of hash and cannabis extracts under the AMMA reflects a broadening of the types of products available to patients. The ability to purchase these products from dispensaries ensures that patients have access to regulated and safe sources of cannabis.

The cultivation rights for medical marijuana patients are particularly noteworthy, as they allow for a significant number of plants (up to 12) to be grown by individuals who may not have easy access to dispensaries. This provision ensures that patients who live in more remote areas of the state can still utilize the medical marijuana program effectively.

For adults, the passage of Proposition 207 marked a significant shift towards the normalization of cannabis use. The ability to possess up to one ounce of cannabis or five grams of concentrate aligns with trends seen in other states that have legalized recreational cannabis. The retail infrastructure, with over 100 dispensaries, indicates a mature market that can cater to the needs of adult consumers.

The cultivation rights for adults, while more limited than those for medical patients, still provide a means for personal production and reflect a respect for individual autonomy in cannabis use. The requirement for cultivation to occur in a locked and enclosed area is a common stipulation aimed at preventing unauthorized access, particularly by minors.

It is important to note that while Arizona has made strides in cannabis legalization, consumption in public places remains prohibited, and driving under the influence of cannabis is illegal. These regulations are in place to balance the rights of individuals with public safety concerns.

The legal framework in Arizona also includes provisions for the expungement of certain marijuana convictions, which is a critical step in addressing the past consequences of marijuana prohibition. This aspect of the law acknowledges the changing perceptions of cannabis use and provides individuals with an opportunity to clear their records.

In conclusion, as of November 2023, Arizona has established comprehensive laws that allow for the possession, purchase, and cultivation of cannabis for both medical patients and adults. The state's approach reflects a balance between providing access to cannabis for those who require it for medical reasons and creating a regulated system for adult recreational use.
