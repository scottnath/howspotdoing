# Cannabis Legality in Virginia: A Comprehensive Report

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

In Virginia, as of the current date, November 18, 2023, medical marijuana patients are legally permitted to possess THC-containing cannabis products. This is contingent upon having a valid prescription issued by a medical doctor for the treatment of an approved condition such as cancer or glaucoma. Additionally, cannabis oil is allowed for students in public schools who have a valid written certification for its use (CFAH, 2023; Virginia NORML, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Yes, medical marijuana patients in Virginia have the legal right to purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. The oversight of these dispensaries is managed by the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority, which ensures that the dispensaries operate within the regulatory framework established by the state (Virginia NORML, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

As of the information available up to June 2023, medical marijuana patients in Virginia are not allowed to grow their own cannabis plants. All medical cannabis must be obtained through one of the state's four medical dispensaries, which are regulated and overseen by the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority (CFAH, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

For adults aged 21 and over, the possession of THC-containing cannabis products is legal in Virginia. The law, which took effect on July 1, 2021, allows adults to possess up to one ounce of marijuana in public. However, it is important to note that the sale of recreational cannabis is not yet established in the state, and possession over the specified limit can lead to legal penalties (NORML, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

As of November 18, 2023, it is not legal for adults to purchase THC-containing cannabis products from a store for recreational use in Virginia. While there have been legislative efforts to establish a retail marijuana market, such as HB 1464 and HB 1750, these bills were tabled and did not pass into law. The current legal framework only permits sales to qualified medical patients through licensed dispensaries (Virginia NORML, 2023; Cannabis Wire, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Yes, adults in Virginia are legally allowed to cultivate up to four plants per household for personal use. This provision was part of the legislation that took effect on July 1, 2021. The cultivation must adhere to specific guidelines, such as not being visible from a public way and preventing access to individuals under the age of 21 (VDH, 2023).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Virginia's cannabis laws as of November 18, 2023, provide a legal framework for the possession, purchase, and use of THC-containing cannabis products for medical patients with valid prescriptions. Medical patients can legally possess and purchase these products from licensed dispensaries but cannot grow their own plants. For adults, possession of up to one ounce of cannabis is legal, and they are permitted to grow up to four plants per household for personal use. However, the retail purchase of cannabis for recreational use is not yet legal, and efforts to establish a regulated market have faced legislative challenges. The future of cannabis legalization in Virginia may hinge on political shifts and further legislative action.
