# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products in West Virginia?

As of 2023, medical marijuana patients in West Virginia are legally permitted to possess THC-containing cannabis products. These products include infused pills, oils, topicals, liquids, dermal patches, and "dry leaf" or "plant form" for vaporization or nebulization (NORML, 2023). The state has operational state-licensed dispensaries from which patients can obtain medical cannabis. To legally possess these products, patients must be registered and hold a valid medical marijuana card issued by the state.

# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Yes, it is legal for medical marijuana patients to purchase THC-containing cannabis products from state-licensed dispensaries in West Virginia. These dispensaries provide access to regulated products for patients who have obtained a medical marijuana card from the state (NuggMD, 2023). The availability of these dispensaries ensures that patients have a legal and safe means to acquire their medication.

# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

No, as of the current date, medical marijuana patients in West Virginia are not allowed to cultivate cannabis for personal use at home (NuggMD, 2023). The state's medical marijuana program does not include provisions for the home cultivation of cannabis by patients. All medical cannabis must be purchased from licensed dispensaries.

# Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Possession of THC-containing cannabis products by adults without a medical marijuana card is illegal in West Virginia. Such possession is considered a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $1,000 (NuggMD, 2023). There are no indications that this will change in the immediate future, and no specific date has been provided for when it might become legal.

# Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Adult-use cannabis sales are not legal in West Virginia. Only medical marijuana patients with a licensed medical marijuana card can legally purchase THC-containing cannabis products from state-licensed dispensaries (NuggMD, 2023). There is no legal avenue for adults without a medical marijuana card to purchase cannabis products in the state.

# Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Cultivation of THC-containing cannabis for personal use is not legal for adults in West Virginia. The state's laws do not permit the personal growing of cannabis for recreational purposes, and doing so could result in criminal charges (NuggMD, 2023). There is no indication of a specific date when this might change.

# Conclusion

In summary, as of November 17, 2023, West Virginia allows medical marijuana patients to possess and purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. However, these patients are not permitted to grow cannabis at home. For adults who are not medical marijuana patients, possession, purchase, and cultivation of THC-containing cannabis remain illegal. While there have been legislative efforts to change these laws, such as House Bill 2091, which proposes the legalization of recreational cannabis, these have not yet been enacted into law (Benzinga, 2023; WBOY, 2023). Therefore, the current legal status remains as described above, with no specific future date for potential legalization.
