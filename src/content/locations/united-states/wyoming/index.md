## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

As of November 18, 2023, it is illegal for medical marijuana patients to possess THC-containing cannabis products in the state of Wyoming. The state has not passed any laws that allow for the medical use of cannabis. Possession of marijuana for both recreational and medical purposes remains prohibited under state law. Wyoming is among the minority of states in the United States that maintain a complete prohibition on cannabis, including for medical use (Wyoming Cannabis Laws, 2023).

Possession of less than 3 ounces of cannabis is punishable by up to 1 year in jail and a fine of up to $1,000. There are no municipalities within Wyoming that have enacted laws to decriminalize cannabis possession, and medical cannabis is not available in the state. Despite ongoing efforts by activists to reform cannabis laws, including attempts to get medical cannabis on the 2022 ballot, no progress has been made in the legislative session of 2023 (NuggMD, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

In Wyoming, there are no provisions that allow medical marijuana patients to legally purchase THC-containing cannabis products in stores. The state does not have a medical marijuana program, and doctors are not permitted to recommend cannabis to patients for any medical condition. Consequently, there are no state-licensed dispensaries or caregivers to provide THC-containing cannabis products to patients (CFAH, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

The cultivation of THC-containing cannabis by medical marijuana patients is illegal in Wyoming. The state does not allow individuals or entities to manufacture, cultivate, or grow marijuana for any purpose, including medical use. Anyone caught growing cannabis in Wyoming faces criminal charges, with penalties including a fine of up to $1,000 and up to 6 months of incarceration (I Love Growing Marijuana, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

For adults in Wyoming, the possession of THC-containing cannabis products is illegal. Possession of under three ounces of cannabis is considered a misdemeanor, with penalties that can include up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. Possession of over three ounces is classified as a felony offense. Wyoming's possession charges for marijuana are among the harshest in the country (Wikipedia, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

There are no legal provisions for adults to purchase THC-containing cannabis products in stores in Wyoming.

As with possession and sale, cultivation of cannabis by adults is subject to criminal penalties, including fines and potential jail time (I Love Growing Marijuana, 2023).

In conclusion, as of the current date, Wyoming maintains some of the most restrictive cannabis laws in the United States. There are no legal avenues for medical marijuana patients or adults to possess, purchase, or cultivate THC-containing cannabis products. Despite public support for cannabis legalization, as indicated by surveys showing a majority of Wyoming residents in favor of medical marijuana if prescribed by a doctor, the state's laws have not changed to reflect this sentiment (University of Wyoming, 2020).

It is important to note that while THC-containing cannabis is illegal, hemp-derived CBD oil with no more than 0.3% THC is legal in Wyoming. The state permits the limited medical use of non-intoxicating CBD oil for patients with intractable epilepsy, provided they carry a "Hemp Extract Identification Card." However, there are no state-licensed dispensaries, and in-state cultivation and production of hemp extracts are not allowed (Marijuana and the Law, 2023).

For the most current and comprehensive information, individuals should consult official Wyoming state laws and regulations.
