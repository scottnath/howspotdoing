## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

As of November 17, 2023, medical marijuana patients in Kentucky are legally permitted to possess THC-containing cannabis products under specific conditions. The state legalized medical cannabis through Senate Bill 47 (SB 47) on March 31, 2023, with the law allowing for the purchase of medical cannabis with a written certification starting from January 1, 2025 (Kentucky Medical Cannabis Program, n.d.). However, an executive order issued by Governor Andy Beshear, which took effect on January 1, 2023, allows individuals with certain severe medical conditions to possess and use small amounts of medical cannabis for treatment. The executive order outlines 21 medical conditions that qualify for medical cannabis use, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, PTSD, and terminal illness (Commonwealth of Kentucky, 2023).

Eligible individuals can possess and use marijuana legally purchased in other states, but they cannot possess more than eight ounces at a time within Kentucky. The executive order also provides a preemptive pardon for qualified individuals accused of marijuana possession (Courier-Journal, 2022).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Currently, there are no legal avenues for medical marijuana patients to purchase THC-containing cannabis products in a store within Kentucky. The full implementation of the medical cannabis program, including the establishment of dispensaries, is not set to occur until January 1, 2025 (Kentucky Medical Cannabis Program, n.d.). Until then, patients are allowed to purchase cannabis outside of the state and possess it within Kentucky under the conditions specified by the executive order (Courier-Journal, 2022).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

The cultivation of cannabis for medical marijuana patients is currently prohibited in Kentucky. There is no provision in the existing legislation or executive orders that allows for the home cultivation of cannabis by medical marijuana patients. The specific regulations related to the cultivation of medical cannabis have not been announced and are expected to be developed by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) before the medical cannabis program becomes operational in 2025 (Kentucky Medical Cannabis Program, n.d.).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

For adults who are not medical marijuana patients, the possession of THC-containing cannabis products remains illegal in Kentucky. Possession of marijuana is a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $250 and 45 days in prison for first-time offenders. Second-time offenders caught with less than eight ounces of marijuana can face up to one year in prison and a $500 fine. Kentucky has not decriminalized marijuana possession, and recreational use of marijuana is still illegal in the state (CFAH, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

As of the current date, it is illegal for adults to buy THC-containing cannabis products in a store in Kentucky. The state has not legalized recreational marijuana, and there are no legal dispensaries or retail outlets for the purchase of THC-containing cannabis products for adult use (Cannigma, n.d.).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

The cultivation of THC-containing cannabis by adults for personal use is illegal in Kentucky. Growing less than five cannabis plants is considered a misdemeanor charge, while repeat charges for cultivation or growing more than five plants is a felony charge. There are no provisions in Kentucky law that allow for the legal cultivation of cannabis by adults for recreational purposes (PotGuide, n.d.).

In conclusion, while Kentucky has taken steps toward legalizing medical cannabis, the state still maintains strict prohibitions on the possession, purchase, and cultivation of THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use. Medical marijuana patients have limited protections under the executive order until the full medical cannabis program is implemented in 2025. It is important for individuals in Kentucky to be aware of the current legal landscape and the potential risks associated with cannabis possession and use.
