The state has a limited medical marijuana program in place for patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy, allowing them to purchase low-THC/high-CBD cannabis oil. However, the production of these products within the state is prohibited (CFah, 2023).

However, as of the current date, this bill is under review and has not been enacted into law (NatLawReview, 2023).
