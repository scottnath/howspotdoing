## Is it legal for adults to buy cannabis in a store in New York?

**YES**

As of 2023, adults in New York can legally purchase cannabis from licensed dispensaries. The state has started rolling out its legal cannabis industry, with the first four adult-use dispensaries now open. Every legal dispensary and product must have state-licensed stamps and QR codes to distinguish them from illicit stores. This development follows the 2021 bill legalizing cannabis possession, use, and purchase for adults 21 and over.

## Is it legal for adults to grow cannabis in New York?

**NO**

Adult-use home cultivation of cannabis plants is currently not allowed. Pursuant to the MRTA, the home cultivation of cannabis plants may only be permitted after the Office of Cannabis Management issues regulations governing home cultivation of cannabis, which must be no later than 18 months after the first adult-use retail sale. Once permitted, New Yorkers 21 years and older can grow up to six plants in their home for personal use (3 mature plants and 3 immature plants) and a maximum of twelve plants per household (6 mature plants and 6 immature plants), even if there are three or more adults 21 and over in the residence.

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

**YES**

In New York State, medical marijuana patients have the legal right to possess THC-containing cannabis products. This is contingent upon the patients being certified by a healthcare provider who is authorized to prescribe controlled substances and has completed a course on medical cannabis. Once certified, patients are automatically registered with the Medical Cannabis Program and do not require a separate registry ID card. The certification includes a registry ID that, along with a government-issued photo ID, allows the purchase of medical cannabis from licensed dispensaries (Cannabis.ny.gov, n.d.).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

**YES**

Yes, it is legal for medical marijuana patients to purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed medical dispensaries in New York State. These dispensaries are operated by Registered Organizations (RO) and are required to have pharmacists on-site to assist patients. The dispensaries display a Medical Dispensary Verification Tool to indicate their legal registration status (Cannabis.ny.gov, n.d.).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

**YES**

As of October 5, 2022, certified medical marijuana patients and their designated caregivers are legally permitted to cultivate cannabis at home. The regulations allow for up to three mature plants and three immature plants per person, with a maximum of six mature and six immature plants per private residence. This home cultivation must occur in a secure location, and the sale of homegrown cannabis is prohibited (Norml.org, 2022; Cannabis.ny.gov, 2022a).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, New York State has established a legal framework that allows both medical marijuana patients and adults to possess, purchase, and cultivate THC-containing cannabis within certain limits. Medical marijuana patients have access to a regulated system for purchasing and growing cannabis, while adults are awaiting the full implementation of the retail market for recreational cannabis. The state has made significant strides in cannabis legalization, with a focus on providing access and ensuring safety and regulation within the industry. As the market evolves, it is expected that adults will soon be able to purchase cannabis products from licensed dispensaries, following the transition of medical cannabis companies to the adult-use market.
