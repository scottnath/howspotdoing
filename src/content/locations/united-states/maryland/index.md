# Cannabis Legality in Maryland

The state of Maryland has undergone significant changes in its approach to cannabis legislation, particularly in the year 2023. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the current legal status of cannabis for both medical marijuana patients and adults, focusing on possession, purchase, and cultivation.

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

In Maryland, the possession of THC-containing cannabis products is legal for registered medical marijuana patients. The state has a regulated medical cannabis program overseen by the Natalie M. LaPrade Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission (MMCC), which became operational on December 1, 2017. While the specific possession limits for medical marijuana patients are not explicitly stated in the provided information, it is understood that patients must adhere to the quantities prescribed by their healthcare providers and as regulated by the MMCC (Wikipedia, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Medical marijuana patients in Maryland have the legal right to purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. These dispensaries are regulated by the MMCC, ensuring that patients have access to safe and legal cannabis for their medical needs. Patients are required to present a valid medical marijuana card at the point of sale, and all transactions are typically conducted in cash, as marijuana products are not covered by insurance. The state has also adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing social-distancing guidelines, which include the allowance of home-delivery services for medical cannabis (Simple Wikipedia, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

As of the information provided, medical marijuana patients in Maryland are not explicitly allowed to grow their own THC-containing cannabis. The state's medical cannabis program does not clearly state whether patients can cultivate cannabis for personal use. Therefore, patients should consult the MMCC for specific guidelines and adhere to any regulations and restrictions that may apply (Simple Wikipedia, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

As of July 1, 2023, it is legal for adults aged 21 and older to possess THC-containing cannabis products in Maryland. The state has legalized the possession of up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis for recreational use. Possession of between 1.5 and 2.5 ounces is decriminalized and punishable by a civil fine of up to $250. Possession of more than 2.5 ounces is considered a criminal misdemeanor, punishable by up to a $1000 fine and up to six months in jail (Wikipedia, 2023; NORML, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Starting July 1, 2023, adults aged 21 and over in Maryland are legally permitted to purchase cannabis from licensed dispensaries. The state has established a regulatory framework for the sale of recreational cannabis, including the use of Metrc for seed-to-sale tracking and the imposition of a 9% sales and use tax on adult-use cannabis. Adults can possess and purchase up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis, and dispensaries must comply with strict licensing, security, and advertising regulations. The Maryland Cannabis Administration (MCA) oversees the regulation of cannabis businesses, and the first round of licensing for the cannabis industry took place in the fall of 2023 (Flowhub, 2023; MMCC, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Adults in Maryland are allowed to grow up to two cannabis plants for personal use starting from July 1, 2023. The cultivation must be conducted out of public view and in a secure manner. It is important to note that while adults can cultivate cannabis at home, the sale of home cultivation products by dispensaries is not mentioned, suggesting that any cannabis grown at home is for personal use only and not for commercial distribution (MPP, 2023).

In conclusion, Maryland has made significant strides in reforming its cannabis laws, with both medical and recreational use now being legal under specific regulations. Medical marijuana patients have access to cannabis through licensed dispensaries, while the state's recreational cannabis program allows adults to possess, purchase, and cultivate cannabis within the established legal framework. As the state continues to develop its cannabis industry, it is essential for individuals to stay informed about the latest regulations and to comply with all legal requirements.
