# Cannabis Legality in Wisconsin: An In-Depth Analysis

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

As of November 17, 2023, medical marijuana patients in Wisconsin do not have the legal right to possess THC-containing cannabis products. The state has not enacted any laws that would allow for the possession of such products for medical purposes. Despite some legislative movements, such as the passage of Assembly Bill 726, also known as Lydia's Law in 2014, and Senate Bill 10 in 2017, the scope of these laws is limited to the use of CBD oil with low levels of THC for specific medical conditions (Wisconsin Watch, 2023; O'Flaherty Law, 2023). Therefore, possession of THC-containing cannabis products by medical marijuana patients remains illegal in Wisconsin.

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Corresponding to the illegality of possession, the purchase of THC-containing cannabis products for medical marijuana patients is also illegal in Wisconsin. The state has not established a medical marijuana program that would permit the sale of such products in stores or dispensaries. Patients are limited to the use of CBD oil, which must contain no more than 0.3% delta-9 THC by dry weight (CFAH, 2023). Consequently, there are no legal avenues for medical marijuana patients to purchase THC-containing cannabis products in Wisconsin.

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Wisconsin law does not permit medical marijuana patients to cultivate THC-containing cannabis. The state has not provided any provisions for patients to grow their own cannabis plants for medical use. The only exception to cannabis cultivation in Wisconsin is the reauthorized cultivation of industrial hemp, which must contain under 0.3% THC (Wikipedia, 2023). Therefore, medical marijuana patients are not legally allowed to grow THC-containing cannabis in Wisconsin.

## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

For adults without a medical marijuana card, the possession of THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use is illegal in Wisconsin. The state has not legalized the possession of cannabis for adult use, and it remains classified as a controlled substance. Possession of any amount is punishable by up to 6 months in prison and a $1,000 fine for a first offense, with subsequent offenses being treated more severely (Wikipedia, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Similarly, the purchase of THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use is illegal in Wisconsin. There are no legal recreational dispensaries in the state where adults can buy cannabis products. The state legislature, which is currently dominated by Republicans, has not approved any bills that would legalize the sale of cannabis for recreational purposes (Wisconsin Watch, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

The cultivation of THC-containing cannabis for recreational purposes is prohibited in Wisconsin. Adults are not allowed to grow cannabis plants for personal use under current state laws. The state's stance on cannabis cultivation aligns with its prohibitions on possession and purchase for recreational use (Wikipedia, 2023).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, as of the current date, both medical and recreational use of THC-containing cannabis products remains illegal in Wisconsin. Despite public support and legislative efforts to change these laws, the state has not yet joined the growing number of states that have legalized cannabis in some form. The future of cannabis legalization in Wisconsin is uncertain, and it is subject to the outcomes of ongoing political processes and potential shifts in the state legislature's stance on this issue.

It is important for individuals and entities interested in the legal status of cannabis in Wisconsin to stay informed about any changes in legislation or regulations.
