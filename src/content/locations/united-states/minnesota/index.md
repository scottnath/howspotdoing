# How's Pot Doing in Minnesota?

<p class="howsit">Cannabis is 90% legal in Minnesota</p>

# Cannabis Legality in Minnesota

The legal landscape for cannabis in Minnesota has undergone significant changes in recent years. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current legal status of cannabis for both medical marijuana patients and adults in Minnesota as of November 17, 2023. The information presented is based on the most recent legislative updates and regulatory guidelines available.

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Yes, medical marijuana has been legal in Minnesota since 2014. Patients with qualifying conditions are allowed to possess THC-containing cannabis products. The possession limits for medical marijuana patients include up to two ounces of cannabis, eight grams of concentrate, 800 milligrams of THC in edibles, and two pounds of cannabis at home. These patients are also allowed to grow up to eight marijuana plants, with a maximum of four flowering plants at once (MPR News, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Medical marijuana patients in Minnesota can purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. Dispensaries have been operational since 2015, initially offering oils, pills, and non-smokable forms, with leaf form becoming available since 2021. Additionally, edibles containing small amounts of hemp-derived THC were legalized in 2022 (MPR News, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Medical marijuana patients in Minnesota are permitted to cultivate their own cannabis plants. The law allows patients to grow up to eight marijuana plants, with no more than four being mature and flowering at any given time. Cultivation exceeding this limit may result in a civil penalty of $500 per plant. It is recommended that the plants be grown in an enclosed, locked space that is not open to public view, and indoor cultivation is advised (MPR News, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Recreational cannabis use and possession for adults aged 21 and older is legal in Minnesota. Adults can possess up to two ounces of cannabis in public without facing criminal charges. Additional possession limits for adults include eight grams of concentrate, 800 milligrams of THC in edibles, and two pounds of cannabis at home. These changes took effect on August 1, 2023, following the decriminalization of cannabis possession, use, and home cultivation (Cannabis.mn.gov, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

While recreational cannabis has been legalized, the sale of THC-containing cannabis products for adult recreational use is not yet fully established in Minnesota. The regulatory framework is still being developed, and recreational dispensaries are not expected to open until 2024 or 2025. However, tribal governments, such as the Red Lake Nation and White Earth Nation, have opened dispensaries for recreational cannabis sales on their sovereign lands (LRL.mn.gov, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Adults in Minnesota are allowed to cultivate their own cannabis plants for personal use. The law permits the cultivation of up to eight marijuana plants per residence, with a maximum of four flowering plants at any given time. The cultivation must take place in an enclosed, locked space that is not visible to the public. This provision also became effective on August 1, 2023 (Star Tribune, 2023; CBS News Minnesota, 2023).

In conclusion, Minnesota has made significant strides in reforming its cannabis laws, both for medical marijuana patients and for adult recreational use. The state has established clear guidelines for possession, purchase, and cultivation, with a focus on regulated access and personal cultivation rights. As the state continues to develop its regulatory framework for the sale of recreational cannabis, it is important for residents and visitors to stay informed about the evolving legal landscape.
