# How's Pot Doing in Louisiana?

<p class="howsit">Cannabis is 20% legal in Louisiana</p>

# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

In Louisiana, medical marijuana is legal for individuals who have been diagnosed with qualifying health conditions. The state's medical marijuana program, established in 2015, has undergone expansions, including an increase in possession limits and the availability of various cannabis products for medical use (cfah.org). As of 2023, patients with a medical marijuana recommendation can legally obtain and possess medical marijuana in forms such as flower, tinctures, chewables, edibles, infused creams or oils, and metered-dose inhalers (transformativehealthcenter.com). The law specifically exempts patients of the state-sponsored medical marijuana program from possession laws, provided they possess medical marijuana in permissible forms for qualifying conditions (legis.la.gov).

# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Medical marijuana patients in Louisiana can legally purchase THC-containing cannabis products from state-licensed dispensaries or pharmacies. There are currently 10 licensed pharmacies and dispensaries in the state where patients can obtain medical marijuana products with a valid recommendation from a licensed healthcare provider (transformativehealthcenter.com). The Louisiana Board of Pharmacy has selected nine state-licensed dispensaries that are operational, and these dispensaries are the only legal outlets for medical marijuana patients to purchase their medication (norml.org).

# Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Home cultivation of cannabis by medical marijuana patients is not permitted in Louisiana. The state's medical marijuana program allows for the cultivation and production of medical cannabis by two selected companies affiliated with LSU and Southern University agricultural centers, but there are no provisions for home cultivation by patients or caregivers (norml.org). Therefore, medical marijuana patients must obtain their cannabis products through the state-licensed dispensaries.

# Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Recreational use of marijuana remains illegal in Louisiana. Possession of marijuana for recreational use is not decriminalized statewide, with penalties including fines and potential jail time for offenses. However, New Orleans has passed an ordinance decriminalizing weed within the city limits (cfah.org). Possession of 14 grams or less of marijuana has been decriminalized, meaning individuals cannot be arrested but may receive a criminal summons to appear in court (attorneycarl.com).

# Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

As of November 17, 2023, the retail sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes remains illegal in Louisiana. There have been legislative efforts to legalize recreational marijuana, but as of the 2023 legislative session, these efforts have not resulted in the passage of any laws allowing for the legal sale of recreational cannabis (mpp.org). Only state-licensed therapeutic marijuana pharmacies are authorized to sell medical cannabis to qualifying patients with recommendations from licensed physicians (louisianastatecannabis.org).

# Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Adults in Louisiana are not allowed to grow THC-containing cannabis for recreational purposes. The state does not permit home cultivation for either medical patients or adults, and selling any amount of marijuana in any form is illegal (ilovegrowingmarijuana.com). The laws are consistent across the state, with no exceptions for personal or recreational cultivation.

In conclusion, while medical marijuana is legal in Louisiana for patients with qualifying conditions, recreational marijuana remains illegal. Medical marijuana patients can legally possess and purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries, but they cannot grow cannabis at home. Adults without a medical marijuana recommendation cannot legally possess, purchase, or grow THC-containing cannabis products in Louisiana as of the current date.
