# Cannabis Legality in Maine: A Comprehensive Overview

The state of Maine has been at the forefront of cannabis legalization in the United States, with a history of progressive policies regarding the use of cannabis for both medical and recreational purposes. This report provides a detailed analysis of the current legal status of cannabis possession, purchase, and cultivation in Maine as of November 17, 2023. The information presented is based on the latest available data and aims to clarify the legal landscape for both medical marijuana patients and adults.

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Yes, it is legal for medical marijuana patients to possess THC-containing cannabis products in Maine. The state has allowed the prescribing and limited possession of medical cannabis since 1999. Maine voters approved the citizen-initiated bill "An act to establish the Maine Medical Marijuana Act" in 2009, making Maine the fifth state to provide for dispensaries of medical-grade cannabis for individuals with debilitating and chronic medical conditions. These dispensaries are licensed and regulated by the Office of Cannabis Policy. Medical marijuana patients who are enrolled in the state's Medical Use of Cannabis Program (MMCP) are legally allowed to possess up to 2.5 ounces of usable marijuana (Maine Legislature, 2023; Maine Cannabis Organization, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Yes, medical marijuana patients in Maine can legally purchase THC-containing cannabis products from registered dispensaries. These dispensaries are authorized to sell cannabis products to patients who possess a valid medical marijuana card. The Office of Cannabis Policy oversees the regulation and licensing of these dispensaries, ensuring that patients have access to medical cannabis for therapeutic purposes (Maine Cannabis Organization, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Yes, medical marijuana patients in Maine are permitted to cultivate their own THC-containing cannabis plants. Registered patients or their designated caregivers can grow up to 6 mature plants, 12 immature plants, and unlimited seedlings for personal use, provided they comply with the state's regulations and possess a valid medical marijuana card. The cultivation must take place in a secure location that is not visible from a public place (Maine Cannabis Organization, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

Yes, adults in Maine are legally allowed to possess THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use. The state legalized the recreational use of cannabis through the Marijuana Legalization Act, which was approved by voters in November 2016. Adults 21 years of age or older are allowed to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana. However, specific regulations and licensing requirements are in place for the adult-use market (Maine Office of Cannabis Policy, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Yes, adults in Maine can purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed retail stores. The Office of Cannabis Policy is responsible for overseeing the licensing and regulation of adult-use cannabis establishments, including retail stores. The first active adult-use establishment licenses, including cultivation licenses, were issued on September 8, 2020. This indicates that the infrastructure for adult-use cannabis sales is in place and operational (Maine Office of Cannabis Policy, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Yes, adults in Maine are allowed to cultivate their own THC-containing cannabis plants for personal use. Adults aged 21 or older can grow up to three flowering plants, 12 immature plants, and unlimited seedlings without a cultivation license. However, municipalities have the authority to regulate home cultivation within their jurisdictions. The cultivation must occur in a secure location that is not visible from a public place. Individuals with certain drug offense convictions may be ineligible to grow marijuana (Maine Cannabis Organization, 2023).

In conclusion, the state of Maine provides a legal framework for both medical and recreational cannabis use. Medical marijuana patients have access to cannabis for therapeutic purposes, and adults can enjoy the recreational use of cannabis within the limits established by state law. It is important to note that while cannabis is legal under state law, it remains illegal under federal law. Therefore, the use of marijuana on federally-owned properties in Maine is prohibited.
