# Cannabis Laws in Alabama

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

In Alabama, medical marijuana patients with qualifying conditions are legally permitted to possess THC-containing cannabis products. This is contingent upon the patient being registered and having a state-issued medical marijuana card (Alabama Cannabis Organization, n.d.). The law specifies that only patients who are 19 years or older can use marijuana for medical purposes. Minors are allowed access to medical cannabis through registered caregivers, who must be their parents or legal guardians (CFAH, 2023).

The Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission (AMCC) regulates the medical marijuana program and has set forth rules regarding the possession limits and restrictions for these patients. Registered patients are allowed to possess up to seventy (70) daily doses at a time, with most cases capped at fifty (50) mg of THC per day (PotGuide, n.d.). It is important to note that the use of edibles and smokable weed is prohibited for registered patients in Alabama (Alabama Cannabis Organization, n.d.).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

Medical marijuana patients in Alabama can legally purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. The AMCC has awarded licenses to businesses to grow, process, and sell medical marijuana within the state. These dispensaries are only allowed to operate in cities and counties that have passed resolutions or ordinances permitting them (AL.com, 2023).

The AMCC has issued licenses to several companies, allowing them to operate dispensaries across the state. Each company is allowed to have a certain number of dispensaries in separate counties. The dispensaries must adhere to the regulations set by the AMCC and operate within the legal framework established by the state (AL.com, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

In Alabama, the cultivation of cannabis by medical marijuana patients is illegal. Patients are required to obtain their THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. The state has not authorized home cultivation for medical marijuana patients, and there are no provisions within the current laws that allow for such practices (NORML, 2023; NuggMD, n.d.).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?

The possession of THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use is illegal in Alabama. Only medical marijuana patients with a valid, unexpired, and unrevoked medical cannabis card are allowed to possess THC-containing cannabis products. Recreational possession of marijuana without a prescription is considered a misdemeanor offense, with penalties including fines and potential jail time (Alabama Cannabis Organization, n.d.; CFAH, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?

The purchase of THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use is illegal in Alabama. There are no provisions within the state laws that allow for the legal sale of recreational marijuana. The state has not decriminalized marijuana, and there are no mentions of recreational marijuana legalization as of the current date (CFAH, 2023; The Cannabis Watcher, 2023).

## Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?

Growing cannabis for recreational purposes is illegal in Alabama. The state laws do not permit the cultivation of THC-containing cannabis for adult use. This applies to both medical marijuana patients and the general adult population. The AMCC and other state authorities have not provided any legal pathways for the home cultivation of cannabis for recreational purposes (NuggMD, n.d.; Bradley, 2021).

In conclusion, Alabama has taken steps to legalize medical marijuana, but recreational cannabis remains illegal. Medical marijuana patients with qualifying conditions can legally possess and purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries, but they cannot grow cannabis. Recreational use, purchase, and cultivation of cannabis are prohibited, with penalties in place for those who violate these laws. It is essential for individuals to adhere to the state's regulations and to consult with legal professionals or official sources for the most accurate and up-to-date information on Alabama's cannabis laws.
