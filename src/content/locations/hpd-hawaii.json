      "validation_notes": "A thorough review of the official Hawaii Department of Health Medical Cannabis Registry Program website (https://health.hawaii.gov/medicalcannabisregistry/) and its subpages did not locate the exact quote: 'Only registered patients and their caregivers may purchase medical cannabis from licensed dispensaries. Adult-use (recreational) cannabis sales are not legal in Hawaii.' While the site and its referenced laws and rules make clear that only registered patients and caregivers may access dispensaries and that recreational sales are not permitted, this precise wording does not appear verbatim anywhere on the government site. The answer 'NO' to the question of whether adults can legally buy cannabis in a store in Hawaii is accurate and consistent with the law, but the quoted text is a paraphrase or summary, not a direct citation from the official source. No correction to the answer is needed, but the quote should not be presented as a verbatim government statement.",
