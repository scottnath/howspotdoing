The laws in place allow registered patients to possess up to 8 ounces of usable marijuana obtained from their plants in their domicile. Patients who are not registered can possess up to 6 ounces of usable marijuana from their plants (MRSC, 2023). Additionally, possession limits for medical cardholders include up to three ounces of usable marijuana, forty-eight ounces of marijuana-infused product in solid form, two hundred sixteen ounces of marijuana-infused product in liquid form, or twenty-one grams of marijuana concentrate (PotGuide, 2023).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-medical-marijuana-patients-to-buy-thc-containing-cannabis-products-in-a-store>Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?</h2><p>Yes, medical marijuana patients in Washington have the legal right to purchase THC-containing cannabis products in a store. Medical marijuana dispensaries offer different pricing and possession options for patients with qualifying conditions. The Cannabis Patient Protection Act, codified into RCW 69.51A, integrates the medical cannabis market with the regulated recreational market, ensuring that patients have access to the products they need (DOH, 2023).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-medical-marijuana-patients-to-grow-thc-containing-cannabis>Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?</h2><p>Medical marijuana patients in Washington are legally allowed to grow their own cannabis. Card-holding patients can cultivate up to six plants, and those with special dispensation from their doctor can grow up to fifteen plants. This provision ensures that patients have the ability to produce their own medicine, potentially reducing the cost and increasing accessibility (PotGuide, 2023).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-adults-to-have-thc-containing-cannabis-products>Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?</h2><p>As of November 2023, adults over the age of 21 in Washington state can legally possess THC-containing cannabis products. The recreational marijuana program, which began operating in 2014, allows adults to purchase and possess up to one ounce of marijuana and up to 16 ounces of marijuana-infused edibles. However, public consumption of marijuana is prohibited, and it is illegal to operate a vehicle under the influence of marijuana (Wagswoofs, 2023; CFAH, 2023).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-adults-to-buy-thc-containing-cannabis-products-in-a-store>Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?</h2><p>Adults over the age of 21 with a valid ID can legally purchase THC-containing cannabis products in Washington state. The possession limit for adults is up to one ounce of flower, 16 ounces of edibles, and seven grams of cannabis concentrates. It is important to note that while the purchase is legal, the sale and distribution of any amount of marijuana without a license is a C-class felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a maximum fine of $10,000 (CFAH, 2023).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-adults-to-grow-thc-containing-cannabis>Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?</h2><p>Currently, home cultivation of cannabis is not legal in Washington for adults, except for registered medical patients with a state-issued permit. However, a bill, HB 1092, has been introduced in the Washington state Legislature that, if enacted, would allow adults 21 and over to grow their own cannabis at home for personal use. The proposed limits would be up to six plants on their private property, with yields limited to 24 ounces or a pound and a half of usable cannabis. Homes with multiple adult residents could legally house up to 12 plants, for up to 48 ounces or three pounds. The bill is still in the early stages and may take time to pass (Leafly, 2023). In conclusion, Washington state has established a legal framework that allows both medical marijuana patients and adults to possess and purchase THC-containing cannabis products. While medical patients have additional rights to grow cannabis, the state is considering legislation to extend this privilege to all adults. It is crucial for individuals to stay informed about the current laws and any future changes that may impact their rights and responsibilities regarding cannabis use.</p><h3 id=references>References</h3><ul><li>MRSC.
