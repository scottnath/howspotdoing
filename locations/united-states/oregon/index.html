As of 2023, patients and their caregivers are authorized to possess up to 24 ounces of cannabis flower and 5 grams of extracts (Oregon State Cannabis, n.d.). This possession limit is significantly higher than the limit set for recreational users, which stands at 2 ounces of marijuana flower in public and 1 ounce of cannabinoid extract. It is important to note that while medical marijuana possession is legal, consumption in public spaces such as rental homes, sidewalks, schools, parks, and federal lands is prohibited (Oregon State Cannabis, n.d.).</p><p>Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?</p><p>Yes, individuals who are 18 years and older and hold a medical marijuana card in Oregon are legally permitted to purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. The purchase limits for concentrates, edibles, and beverages for medical marijuana patients align with those for recreational users. However, the specific purchase limits for these products are not detailed in the provided information (CFAH, n.d.).</p><p>Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?</p><p>Medical marijuana patients in Oregon are allowed to cultivate cannabis for personal use. Both medical and recreational users are permitted to grow up to 4 marijuana plants per household. It is crucial to adhere to this limit, as exceeding it or growing more than 8 plants at home without a license can lead to legal penalties, including fines or imprisonment (CFAH, n.d.).</p><p>Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?</p><p>Adults aged 21 and over in Oregon are legally allowed to possess THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use. The possession limits for adults in public are up to 2 ounces of marijuana flower and 1 ounce of cannabinoid extract. In private residences, adults can possess up to 8 ounces of usable cannabis. Similar to medical marijuana laws, the use of cannabis in public spaces is prohibited (Oregon State Cannabis, n.d.).</p><p>Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?</p><p>Adults in Oregon can legally purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries for recreational use. The Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission (OLCC) has implemented regulations that include the continuation of on-site delivery services and the operation of walk-up or drive-up windows for cannabis retailers. However, sales are restricted if a minor is present in the vehicle during the transaction, unless the minor is over 18 and holds a medical marijuana card or is accompanied by a parent or guardian with a medical marijuana card (KOIN, n.d.).</p><p>Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?</p><p>Yes, it is legal for adults in Oregon to cultivate THC-containing cannabis plants for recreational use, with the same household limit of 4 plants that applies to medical marijuana patients. This regulation allows individuals to grow cannabis for personal use without the need for a commercial license, provided they adhere to the plant count restrictions (Cannabiz Media, n.d.).</p><p>In conclusion, Oregon has established a legal framework that allows both medical marijuana patients and adults to possess, purchase, and cultivate THC-containing cannabis within specified limits. It is essential for individuals to remain informed about the specific regulations and to comply with the legal requirements to avoid penalties. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, consulting the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) and Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR) is recommended.</p><p>References Oregon State Cannabis. (n.d.).
