Patients with specified medical conditions are allowed to purchase, possess, and use cannabis and related products from Alternative Treatment Centers (ATCs). The law permits registered patients to obtain a maximum of two ounces of marijuana within a ten-day period (CFAH, 2023). This indicates that the state recognizes the medicinal value of cannabis and provides a legal framework for patients to access the treatment they need.</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-medical-marijuana-patients-to-buy-thc-containing-cannabis-products-in-a-store>Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?</h2><p>Yes, it is legal for medical marijuana patients to buy THC-containing cannabis products in a store. New Hampshire has established state-licensed dispensaries, known as Alternative Treatment Centers, where qualifying patients can obtain medical marijuana products (NORML, 2013). These centers are regulated by the state to ensure that patients have access to safe and legal cannabis for therapeutic purposes.</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-medical-marijuana-patients-to-grow-thc-containing-cannabis>Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?</h2><p>As of the current information available, home cultivation of medical marijuana is not allowed in New Hampshire. There have been legislative efforts to permit home cultivation for medical purposes, but these bills have not been successful in passing the Senate (CFAH, 2023). Therefore, patients are required to obtain their medical cannabis exclusively from licensed dispensaries.</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-adults-to-have-thc-containing-cannabis-products>Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?</h2><p>Adult possession of THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use is not legal in New Hampshire. However, the state has decriminalized the possession of small amounts of cannabis. Specifically, possession of up to three-quarters of an ounce of cannabis has been decriminalized since 2017 (New Hampshire Bulletin, 2023). While this does not make possession legal, it reduces the penalties associated with small amounts, indicating a shift towards more lenient policies.</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-adults-to-buy-thc-containing-cannabis-products-in-a-store>Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?</h2><p>Currently, it is not legal for adults to buy THC-containing cannabis products in a store for recreational use in New Hampshire. The state has not established a legal market for the retail sale of recreational cannabis. However, there is significant legislative activity aimed at changing this, with bills being considered that could legalize and regulate cannabis for adult use (MPP, 2023).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-adults-to-grow-thc-containing-cannabis>Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?</h2><p>As of the information available, it is not legal for adults to grow THC-containing cannabis for recreational purposes in New Hampshire. House Bill 344-FN, introduced in 2023, proposes to allow adults to cultivate up to six cannabis plants at home in a secure location. However, this bill is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2024, and only if it is passed into law (LegiScan, 2023). Until then, home cultivation remains illegal for recreational purposes.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, New Hampshire provides a legal framework for medical marijuana patients to possess and purchase THC-containing cannabis products through a regulated program. However, the state does not currently allow for the home cultivation of medical cannabis. For adult recreational use, possession of small amounts has been decriminalized, but the purchase, possession, and cultivation of THC-containing cannabis remain illegal. Legislative efforts are underway to potentially change these laws, with a focus on establishing a regulated market for adult use, including home cultivation provisions. The outcome of these efforts will be pivotal in shaping the future of cannabis policy in New Hampshire.</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ul><li>CFAH. (2023). New Hampshire Marijuana Laws.
