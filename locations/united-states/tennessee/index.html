The state does not have a comprehensive medical marijuana program, and the possession of THC-containing cannabis products for medical purposes is not legal. Tennessee law only permits the use of cannabidiol (CBD) products containing less than 0.9% THC for the treatment of intractable seizures. This means that medical marijuana patients in Tennessee are limited to possessing only low-THC, high-CBD oils, and there is no infrastructure in place to provide these oils to patients in need (CFAH, 2023; MPP, 2023).</p><p>The possession of up to ½ ounce of marijuana for personal use is considered a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $250 fine for a first offense. This law applies to all individuals, including medical marijuana patients. There is no exception or protection for medical marijuana patients regarding the possession of THC-containing cannabis products (CFAH, 2023).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-medical-marijuana-patients-to-buy-thc-containing-cannabis-products-in-a-store>Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?</h2><p>Medical marijuana patients in Tennessee cannot legally purchase THC-containing cannabis products in stores. The state has not established a system of dispensaries or any other legal means for patients to obtain medical cannabis. While there have been efforts to establish a medical marijuana program, including the creation of a Medical Cannabis Commission, the program can only begin when marijuana use becomes legal at both the state and federal levels (Tennessee Cannabis, 2023).</p><p>Patients are allowed to possess CBD oil with less than 0.9% THC for certain medical conditions, but they must source their oil from other states. The oil must be acquired legally within the United States and outside of Tennessee, and purchasers must be able to show proof of legal purchase. Additionally, the CBD products must have a manufacturer’s label stating that the product contains less than 0.9% THC (Weedmaps, 2021).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-medical-marijuana-patients-to-grow-thc-containing-cannabis>Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?</h2><p>The cultivation of THC-containing cannabis by medical marijuana patients is illegal in Tennessee. The state law does not provide any allowances for the cultivation of cannabis for medical purposes. Growing cannabis is considered a Class E Felony for 10 plants or less, with a minimum mandatory prison sentence of 1 year and a fine of up to $5,000. The penalties increase with the number of plants being cultivated (CFAH, 2023).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-adults-to-have-thc-containing-cannabis-products>Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?</h2><p>For adults in Tennessee, the possession of THC-containing cannabis products is illegal. The state has not legalized cannabis for recreational use. Possession of a half ounce of marijuana or less is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and a maximum fine of $2,500. The Nashville District Attorney’s Office announced in 2020 that it would no longer prosecute for possession of less than 0.5 ounce of marijuana, but this policy does not equate to statewide decriminalization (Weedmaps, 2021).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-adults-to-buy-thc-containing-cannabis-products-in-a-store>Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?</h2><p>Adults in Tennessee cannot legally purchase THC-containing cannabis products in stores for recreational use. The state has not established any legal framework for the sale of recreational cannabis, and there are no licensed dispensaries for adult-use cannabis. The sale of hemp-derived cannabinoid products, including delta-8, is regulated, and it is illegal to sell these products to anyone under the age of 21. However, these regulations do not extend to THC-containing cannabis products for recreational use (The Cannabis Watcher, 2023; GlobeNewswire, 2023).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-adults-to-grow-thc-containing-cannabis>Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?</h2><p>The cultivation of THC-containing cannabis for personal, recreational use is illegal in Tennessee. Adults are not permitted to grow cannabis plants, and doing so is subject to criminal penalties. As previously mentioned, the cultivation of 10 plants or less is a Class E felony, punishable by 1-6 years of incarceration and a maximum fine of $3,000 (NORML, 2023).</p><p>In conclusion, Tennessee maintains a prohibitive stance on the possession, purchase, and cultivation of THC-containing cannabis products, both for medical patients and adults. There is no legal framework for medical dispensaries, and the state has not legalized recreational cannabis. Efforts to reform cannabis policies have been met with resistance, and the state awaits recommendations from the Tennessee Medical Marijuana Commission, which are expected in 2024 (MPP, 2023).</p><h3 id=references>References</h3><ul><li>CFAH.
