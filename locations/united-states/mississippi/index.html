Mississippi</p><h1 id=detailed-report-on-cannabis-legality-in-mississippi>Detailed Report on Cannabis Legality in Mississippi</h1><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-medical-marijuana-patients-to-possess-thc-containing-cannabis-products>Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Possess THC-Containing Cannabis Products?</h2><p>As of the latest information available, medical marijuana possession is legal in Mississippi for individuals with a recognized medical condition and an authorized medical card. The Mississippi Medical Cannabis Act, which was signed into law by Governor Tate Reeves in February 2022, allows patients to possess and use medical cannabis for certain debilitating medical conditions (Mississippi State Cannabis, 2023). Patients are allowed to purchase up to 3 ounces of marijuana per month. However, exceeding the monthly limit can result in penalties similar to those for recreational users (CFAH, 2023).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-medical-marijuana-patients-to-buy-thc-containing-cannabis-products-in-a-store>Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?</h2><p>Yes, it is legal for medical marijuana patients to buy THC-containing cannabis products in a store in Mississippi. The state’s medical cannabis program has been set to launch, with licenses being issued to cannabis establishments across the state. As of late December 2022, patients had not yet been able to purchase cannabis products due to delays in testing labs becoming operational. However, the state worked to address this issue, and product sales were expected to begin in late January or February 2023 (NatLawReview, 2023). By August 15, 2023, there were 21,459 registered patients, and 185 licensed medical cannabis dispensaries, indicating that the purchase of medical cannabis in stores is operational (JDSupra, 2023).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-medical-marijuana-patients-to-grow-thc-containing-cannabis>Is it Legal for Medical Marijuana Patients to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?</h2><p>The cultivation of cannabis for medical purposes by patients is not explicitly mentioned in the provided summaries. However, given the regulatory nature of the medical cannabis program in Mississippi, it is likely that cultivation by individuals is not permitted. The Mississippi Department of Health regulates and licenses cannabis cultivation, suggesting that cultivation is limited to licensed entities rather than patients themselves (Mississippi State Cannabis, 2023).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-adults-to-have-thc-containing-cannabis-products>Is it Legal for Adults to Have THC-Containing Cannabis Products?</h2><p>Recreational marijuana remains illegal in Mississippi. Possession of 30 grams or less has been decriminalized, with a first offense resulting in a fine of $250. Subsequent offenses can lead to fines, imprisonment, and increasing penalties based on the amount of marijuana possessed (CFAH, 2023). Therefore, it is not legal for adults to possess THC-containing cannabis products outside of the medical program.</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-adults-to-buy-thc-containing-cannabis-products-in-a-store>Is it Legal for Adults to Buy THC-Containing Cannabis Products in a Store?</h2><p>There are no provisions for the legal purchase of THC-containing cannabis products for adult recreational use in Mississippi. The state has not legalized recreational marijuana, and therefore, purchasing THC-containing cannabis products in a store is not permitted for adults who are not registered medical marijuana patients (Mississippi State Cannabis, 2023).</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-for-adults-to-grow-thc-containing-cannabis>Is it Legal for Adults to Grow THC-Containing Cannabis?</h2><p>Adult cultivation of THC-containing cannabis for personal use is illegal in Mississippi. The Mississippi Marijuana and Hemp Decriminalization Initiative, which would have legalized home cultivation of up to 99 plants without a license, did not appear on the ballot in Mississippi as an indirect initiated constitutional amendment on November 7, 2023. As a result, the current status of home cultivation laws for THC cannabis in Mississippi in 2023 remains that it is not permitted (Ballotpedia, 2023).</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, Mississippi has legalized medical marijuana for patients with qualifying conditions, allowing them to possess and purchase THC-containing cannabis products from licensed dispensaries. However, the cultivation of cannabis by medical marijuana patients is not mentioned, suggesting that it remains illegal. Recreational use of cannabis, including possession, purchase, and cultivation, is illegal in Mississippi as of November 17, 2023. The state has made significant progress in implementing its medical cannabis program, with dispensaries opening and sales beginning. The future of cannabis legislation in Mississippi may evolve, but as of the current date, recreational cannabis remains prohibited.</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ul><li>Mississippi State Cannabis.
